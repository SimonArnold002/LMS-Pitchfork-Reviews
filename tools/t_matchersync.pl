# FLEET MATCHER SYNC — the three Discography-origin rules ported into PFR (0.9.33).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `_norm`/`%FOLD`/`_albumMatches` are ONE engine copied into five repos, and
# they had drifted for weeks with Discography ahead: DSC proved three rules in the field and
# held them DSC-only until they were worth porting. This suite is the gate for that port, so
# each rule is pinned by the failure that MOTIVATED it rather than by a tidy synthetic case.
#
# The three, and the field failure each one closes:
#   1. APOSTROPHES ELIDE (DSC 0.44.26). Spacing the mark keyed "Jane's Addiction" as
#      'jane s addiction' against 'janes addiction'. `_artistMatch` is an exact-token SUBSET
#      test and the artist gate is MANDATORY, so the act matched NOTHING from any source.
#   2. %FOLD 10 -> ~90 entries (DSC 0.44.26). Extended-Latin/IPA letters survived NFD as
#      themselves, so a stylised name keyed differently from its plain spelling.
#   3. COMPOUND-WORD collapse in `_albumMatches` (DSC 0.50.6). The Rolling Stones' 1964 debut
#      is "England's Newest Hit Makers" on MusicBrainz and "…Hitmakers" on the services; no
#      tier treated a space as optional, so the tile was hidden.
#
# THE REGRESSION HALF MATTERS AS MUCH AS THE PORT. Rule 1 lands right next to the "!" fold
# (PFR 0.7.8), which has its own all-marks fallback so "!!!" does not normalise to empty and
# get rejected by that same mandatory artist gate — the apostrophe rule must not disturb it.
# And rule 3 is EXACT collapsed equality, never a prefix: collapsing spaces destroys the word
# boundary the prefix tiers rely on, so a prefix rule here would let "hitmakers…" swallow an
# unrelated title. Both are asserted below as NEGATIVES.
#
# Uses the REAL subs AND the REAL %FOLD grabbed from Browse.pm — no stubbed copies, so a
# change to either fails here rather than passing against a stale duplicate.
#
# Run from the repo root:  perl tools/t_matchersync.pl

# FIXTURES ARE UPGRADED, and this is a real trap rather than ceremony. Perl only sets the
# UTF8 flag on a literal once it carries a codepoint ABOVE U+00FF, so "\x{f0}ark" is stored
# as unflagged latin-1 while "\x{283}ine" is flagged. `_norm` folds only inside
# `if ($HAVE_NFD && utf8::is_utf8($s))`, so an unflagged fixture silently SKIPS the fold and
# the assertion fails against perfectly good code — which is exactly what happened first time
# round here, and it failed only for the sub-256 entries (\x{f0}, \x{e6}, \x{f3}). Live input
# is decoded from the services' JSON and always arrives flagged, so upgrading reproduces
# production rather than papering over it. See the fleet's chars-vs-octets note.
