# Streaming adapter spec — requirements for adding a service

**What this is.** The contract a streaming-service adapter must meet in these plugins, and
the acceptance criteria it is reviewed against. Read it before writing code; it should be
enough on its own, without reading the rest of the plugin first.

**Applies to:** ListenBrainz Fresh Releases (LBF), Pitchfork Reviews (PFR), Listen to
Later (LL).

**Copies of this file.** Each plugin carries its own copy, so the paths in it resolve from
inside the repo you are working in:

    LMS-ListenBrainz-New-Releases/docs/streaming-adapter-spec.md   (canonical)
    LMS-Pitchfork-Reviews/docs/streaming-adapter-spec.md
    LMS-Listen-to-Later/docs/streaming-adapter-spec.md

They are **verbatim** copies. Edit the canonical one and re-copy over the others in the same
session — the same rule the shared matcher follows. To check for drift, compare the three
files' checksums; they must agree.

**Terms used throughout.**

- **Adapter** — one entry in a plugin's adapter table, plus the search functions it points at.
- **Service plugin** — the third-party LMS plugin that actually talks to the service
  (Qobuz, TIDAL, Deezer, Spotty, …). We never talk to a streaming API directly; the adapter
  calls the service plugin.
- **Leg** — one capability of an adapter, such as album search or track search.
- **Item** — an XMLBrowser menu node produced by the service plugin's own renderer.

## How to use this document

Sections 2 to 6 are the contract; everything else is context or process. If you are writing
an adapter, work through them in order and then use section 10 as the checklist.

| Section | What it does | Read it when |
|---|---|---|
| **1. The rule** | States the boundary: an adapter is three edits, and what must never be changed alongside it | Before starting, and again before opening a pull request |
| **2. What the service plugin must expose** | Eight requirements (R1-R8) the third-party service plugin has to satisfy, plus three optional fields. A service failing R1-R3 cannot be adapted | First. It decides whether the work is possible at all |
| **3. The adapter table entry** | The shape of the registry entry, what `name` controls, and where the table lives in each plugin | When writing the entry |
| **4. Album leg** | The album search function: signature, what to send a service versus what to validate locally, the three ways to return a result and the cache TTL each picks, and the fields to stamp on a matched item | When writing the album search |
| **5. Track leg** | The same for track search, including the plain-string url requirement and when it is acceptable to return nothing | When writing the track search, or deciding not to |
| **6. Caching and rebuilds** | Why items are serialised without their url, and what an item may therefore contain | Alongside sections 4 and 5 — it constrains both |
| **7. Summary: what not to do** | The prohibitions from sections 1 to 6 in one list | As a quick pass before review |
| **8. Adapter-table fields still to be added** | Sites that currently force an edit outside the table, per plugin, and the field that would remove each | When a required edit falls outside the table — the fix belongs here, not in a new branch |
| **9. Per-plugin status** | Which plugins are ready, what a new service costs in each, and which need work first | When choosing where to add a service |
| **10. Definition of done** | Code checks and the tests to run on a server with the service installed | Before declaring the adapter finished |
| **11. What the pull request must contain** | The four things a reviewer needs in order to accept it | When opening the pull request |
| **Appendix** | A completed section 2 assessment for one candidate service, as a template for the next one | As an example of the expected output of section 2 |

---

## 1. The rule

> **Adding a service is: one entry in one adapter table, one pref default, one settings row.**

If a service cannot be added within those three edits, the adapter table is missing a field.
Section 8 lists the fields that are still missing and where they are needed. Adding a
per-service `if ($svc eq '…')` branch anywhere else is not an acceptable substitute.

Two rules follow directly, and both matter on day one:

- **MUST NOT bump any cache key.** Every stream, track, playlist and trending cache key
  already includes the ordered list of enabled services (`_streamKey` in
  `ListenBrainzFreshReleases/Browse.pm`, and in `PitchforkReviews/Browse.pm`). Registering an adapter changes that list, so
  every affected entry is invalidated automatically. An extra bump only forces a second,
  redundant re-resolve.
- **MUST NOT change the shared matcher.** `_albumMatches`, `_trackMatches` and `_norm` are
  one engine kept in step across the plugins. An adapter that appears to need the matcher
  loosened is normally sending a mis-encoded query or reading the wrong field from a
  candidate; fix that instead.

---

## 2. What the service plugin must expose

Verify each of these against the service plugin's **deployed source**, and record the
`file:line` you verified it at. Never infer a signature from another service's plugin, and
never rely on a README.

| # | Requirement | Purpose | Symptom if unmet |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R1** | An album search entry point callable from outside the plugin: takes a query string, calls back with candidates | The album leg | Without it there is no adapter |
| **R2** | An album renderer that produces a playable item (`url` coderef plus `passthrough`, or a plain string `play` url) | Items must come from the service plugin's own renderer so they stay correct across its updates | A hand-built item breaks silently when the service plugin changes |
| **R3** | The renderer's `url` coderef must be reachable by name, e.g. `\&Plugins::X::Plugin::getAlbum` | Coderefs cannot be serialised, so cached matches are rebuilt on read (section 6) | The match plays once, then disappears on the next page open, with no error logged |
| **R4** | A track search whose rendered item carries a **plain string** url | Coderef urls cannot survive the resolved-playlist cache, so the track leg rejects them | Playlist rows silently drop out when the list is revisited |
| **R5** | A way to tell "could not query" apart from "queried, no results" | Chooses the cache TTL: a transient failure must retry soon, a real miss must not | A permanently unavailable service makes every genuine miss retry hourly, indefinitely |
| **R6** | Whether the plugin's URL layer wants **characters** or **octets** | Encoding is picked per adapter at the call site | Silent: accented names return nothing. Check this first on empty results |
| **R7** | An `<icon>` entry in the service plugin's `install.xml` | Used as the row thumbnail so the user can see which service matched | Rows render without an icon. Cosmetic |
| **R8** | The exact methods the adapter will call, testable with `->can` | `->can` on an absent package is safe, and is how "installed and enabled" is detected | Probing methods you don't call means the service stops registering if any of them is renamed upstream |

Optional; each degrades cleanly when absent:

| Field | Used for | If absent |
|---|---|---|
| Release type (`release_type`, `record_type`, `album_type`, `type`) or a track count | Classifying a candidate as album / single / EP, so a same-named single doesn't stand in for an album | Candidate is classified unknown and is never dropped |
| Release date or year on the search payload | Last-resort release year for date-ordered lists | Falls back to whatever date the source data carried |
| A native album id | Building a favourites url for the Listen to Later handshake | The row still plays; it just can't be saved with full metadata |

The service plugin does **not** have to resemble the others. A different calling convention
(class methods, renderers in a separate module, pre-normalised results) is fine. R1–R8 are
the requirements; family resemblance is not.

**Check the favourites url's SHAPE, not just its presence.** R2's "playable item" says
nothing about what the renderer puts in `favorites_url`, and that field is what Listen to
Later receives as Material's `$FAVURL`. Every service but one sends a scheme url
(`tidal://album:123`); Spotty sends a bare Spotify URI (`spotify:album:<id>`) with no `//`
at all. LL reads a favurl as a scheme url in four separate places, so a URI-shaped favurl
silently failed every one of them: the album read as a local-library row, a track was not
recognised as a track, and the album id sitting in the favurl was never captured. The fix
was a single normalisation at the point the favurl enters, **not** a Spotify case in each
reader — if a service's favurl is not a scheme url, normalise it once at the boundary and
leave the generic readers alone. Worth a line in the section 2 assessment for any new
service: write down the literal favurl string for an album, a track and a playlist.

---

## 3. The adapter table entry

Reference shape (LBF's Spotify entry, `_streamingAdapters` in `ListenBrainzFreshReleases/Browse.pm`):

```perl
push @adapters, {
    name      => 'Spotify',                       # display name, and the key for svc_priority_<lc name>
    icon      => _pluginIcon('Plugins::Spotty::Plugin'),
    run       => \&_searchSpotify,                # album leg  (section 4)
    runTrack  => \&_searchSpotifyTrack,           # track leg  (section 5) — omit if unsupported
    query_enc => 'chars',                         # 'chars' | 'bytes'  (R6)
    ready     => sub { … },                       # LBF only, optional: is the service signed in yet?
                                                  # (streamingNotReady holds the warm while it is false)
} if Plugins::Spotty::Plugin->can('getAPIHandler')  # R8 — exactly the methods used, no others
  && Plugins::Spotty::OPML->can('_albumItem')
  && Plugins::Spotty::OPML->can('trackList')
  && Plugins::Spotty::OPML->can('album');
```

`name` is the adapter's identity: it keys the priority pref, the cache tag, the settings row
and the cached-item rebuild. It **MUST** stay stable once shipped — renaming it resets every
user's configured priority for that service.

Ordering and enablement are not the adapter's concern. A separate function sorts adapters by
`svc_priority_<name>` and drops any set to 0.

Where the table lives, and the legs each plugin defines:

| Plugin | Table | Legs |
|---|---|---|
| LBF | `_streamingAdapters` in `ListenBrainzFreshReleases/Browse.pm` | `run`, `runTrack` |
| PFR | `our @SERVICES`, read by `_detectAdapters`, in `PitchforkReviews/Browse.pm` | `run` |
| LL | none — recognises a source rather than searching for one; see section 9 | — |

Where a plugin grows a third leg, prefer collecting them into a named sub-hash
(`legs => { albums => …, tracks => … }`, `undef` for one that isn't built yet) rather than
adding another top-level key, so adding a leg later never changes an adapter's arity.

---

## 4. Album leg (`run`)

```perl
sub _searchX {
    my ($client, $query, $artistNorm, $albumNorm, $svc, $collect, $albumRaw) = @_;
```

Called once per enabled adapter, in parallel. The highest-priority service that matched wins
as soon as every service ahead of it has settled.

**Inputs.** `$query` is the raw artist name, already spelled per the adapter's `query_enc`.
`$artistNorm` and `$albumNorm` are normalised forms for validation only — never send them to
a service, because normalisation replaces punctuation with spaces and the service's own
search then fails to find stylised names. Validate every candidate with
`_albumMatches($artistNorm, $albumNorm, $candArtist, $candTitle, $albumRaw)`.

The search is deliberately wide and the filtering is local: search the **artist** and select
the album yourself. Searching "artist album" as one string makes services rank or drop the
target.

**Output — call `$collect` exactly once:**

| Call | Meaning | Cache TTL |
|---|---|---|
| `$collect->([$item, …])` | Matches found | 7 days |
| `$collect->([])` | Queried successfully, nothing matched | 24 hours (album) / 7 days (track) |
| `$collect->(undef)` | Could not query: no handler, unexpected response shape, renderer failed | Retried on a bounded schedule, then accepted |

`undef` means "ask again soon". Use it only for states that can clear on their own. A
**permanent** condition — for example, the service plugin is installed but has no account
configured at all — **MUST** report `[]`, because a permanent state reported as inconclusive
spends the whole retry budget on a question that cannot change.

**The retry is bounded (LBF 0.9.195, `MISS_RETRY_SCHEDULE`).** An inconclusive miss is
re-searched at 1h, 6h and 24h and is then accepted as an ordinary durable no-match. Earlier
builds retried on a flat 1-hour TTL, which never ended: a track genuinely on no service answers
inconclusively every time, so it re-searched for ever and the resolved-list cache stayed short
on the same clock. **An adapter author does not schedule anything — report `undef` and the
caller owns the budget. Never add an internal retry loop.**

**ZERO RAW RESULTS IS AN ERROR SIGNAL, NOT AN EMPTY CATALOGUE — and it is the caller's rule, not
yours.** These searches hit fuzzy indexes that answer with up to 20-200 rows; even a release the
service never carried returns near-misses. So a leg that matched nothing out of a completely
empty raw list is settled as inconclusive rather than as a confirmed miss, at the call site, via
`_emptyResultIsError`. This matters most for a plugin whose transport **swallows errors**: Spotty's
Pipeline hands an error hash to its extractor, which extracts to nothing, so a failed search is
byte-identical to a clean zero-hit and `undef` can never reach us from it. **If your service's
index is genuinely sparse — Bandcamp — say so and stay out of the rule**, or a permanently absent
album retries on every cycle for ever.

**MUST**

- Use asynchronous HTTP only. A leg that parses a large response synchronously blocks the
  server's event loop for every user, not just the caller.
- Wrap every call into the service plugin's renderer in `eval`. The leg runs inside an async
  callback, so a die there is not caught by the caller. Skip the bad item; if that leaves no
  items and a renderer failed, report `undef` rather than `[]`.
- Let the per-service timeout (8 seconds) settle the leg as inconclusive. Do not add an
  internal retry loop.

**MUST NOT**

- Set `image`. The caller replaces it with the service icon and passes the original artwork
  on to the favourites-url builder.
- Set `favorites_url`, unless the service plugin's own value is already correct and
  replayable. See `native_favurl` in section 8.
- Build a playable item by hand instead of calling the service plugin's renderer (R2).

**Fields to stamp on each matched item.** All plain scalars, so they survive caching:

| Field | Value | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `_albumid` | Native album id — parse it from the item's uri if there is no bare id field | Favourites url / Listen to Later handshake |
| `_svctitle` | The service's own raw album title. Not the rendered row label (which usually has the artist baked in) and not the MusicBrainz title | The album name sent in the handshake |
| `_ctype` | `_candReleaseType($rawAlbum)` — `album`, `single`, `ep`, or `''` | Dropping a same-named single for an album target |
| `_year` | `_svcYear($rawAlbum)` | Release-year fallback in date-ordered lists |

The caller stamps the service name itself; the adapter does not.

**The handshake has ONE carrier, and `native_favurl` removes it** (measured 2026-09-16). `_albumid`,
`_svctitle` and `_year` reach Listen to Later only as query parameters on the favourites url that
`_attachFavUrl` builds. A service flagged `native_favurl` skips that builder, so **every one of those
fields is silently dropped** for it — the adapter still computes them, and nothing says they went
nowhere. Listen to Later then stores the row LABEL as the album title. For a sibling whose label
carries the artist (Pitchfork Reviews: `"Artist - Album"`, `"3. Artist - Album"`) that is the wrong
title. Listen to Later recovers the artist and year itself from the service, and for Spotify, since
2026-09-16, also replaces a label title with the Spotify album's own name, so the row shows what the
sibling matched to. Played does not depend on that: since 2026-09-16 (LL working tree,
installed and tested in LL 1.0.3 dev; its live playback test is deferred and classed OK) Listen
to Later matches a Spotify play by RELEASE ID, read from Spotty's track
cache, before any title. Status and evidence: LL `CLAUDE.md` §B, `A SPOTIFY ROW'S STORED ALBUM
TITLE CAN NEVER MATCH`. **If you set `native_favurl` for any OTHER service, you own that gap** —
Played has no id door for it, so say in the pull request how the title reaches Listen to Later,
or that it does not.

**`_svctitle` is the service's title at BROWSE, which is not always what it reports at PLAYBACK.**
Played matches on the string the service's protocol handler returns while a track plays. Spotty runs
that string through `API::Cache->cleanupTags` when its `cleanupTags` pref is on — **the default** —
which removes a bracketed or dash-suffixed part containing `deluxe`, `edition`, `remaster`, `live` or
`anniversary`, and nothing else. The album object is never cleaned. Measured:
`Mixed Up (Remastered 2018 / Deluxe Edition)` at browse is `Mixed Up` at playback, while
`American Football (LP2)` is the same at both. Before sending any title for Played to match, check the
service's playback metadata, not its search result: append one `<scheme>://track:` url to a stopped
player and read `status` with `tags:aAlKuN` — audio need not play for the metadata to resolve.
This is why Listen to Later's Spotify door matches by id, not title: the cleaned name is the SAME
for two editions (`Mixed Up` 1990 and its 2018 remaster), so no title can tell them apart.

---

## 5. Track leg (`runTrack`)

```perl
sub _searchXTrack {
    my ($client, $query, $artistNorm, $titleNorm, $album, $collect) = @_;
```

`$collect` behaves exactly as in section 4. Differences:

- **The url MUST be a plain string.** Items with a coderef url are filtered out, because a
  resolved playlist has to stay cacheable and stable in length. Set `url`, `play` and
  `type => 'audio'` to the same string.
- If the service plugin's renderer builds a composite label ("Title BY Artist FROM Album"),
  reset the item's `name` to the bare title. Downstream display and de-duplication both key
  on `name`.
- Validate with `_trackMatches`, accepting a match against **any** credited artist.
- Stamp `_year`.
- A leg that immediately calls `$collect->([])` is acceptable where per-track streaming isn't
  reliable, provided the reason is stated in a comment. Omitting `runTrack` entirely is also
  fine: the adapter is then simply skipped for tracks.

---

## 6. Caching and rebuilds

Matched items are serialised. The `url` coderef is stripped when an item is cached and
reattached, per service, when it is read back. Therefore:

- everything else on the item **MUST** be plain data, including the `passthrough` the service
  plugin's renderer set — that is where the album id has to live for the rebuild to work;
- no blessed references, no closures, and never the client object;
- **the rebuild path (R3) is mandatory.** An adapter with search and rendering but no rebuild
  will match, play, and then lose the match on the next page open without logging anything.

### Rate limits — a refused search is not an answer

A service that is rate-limiting you has **not** told you anything about its catalogue, and some
plugins hide that completely: Spotty swallows a 429 into the **same empty arrayref** a genuine
zero-hit produces, having sent no request at all (it sets `spotty_rate_limit_exceeded` for the
`Retry-After` and then refuses every call server-wide, the user's own browsing included). So:

- **Never let an empty answer from a rate-limited service become a verdict.** Where the service
  plugin exposes the state — Spotty's `Plugins::Spotty::API::hasError429` — check it before
  treating an empty list as a miss. Only an EMPTY list is doubted; a list with results in it is
  an answer whatever the flag says.
- **Do not add a second backoff.** The service plugin already owns the wait. What the adapter
  owes is reading the refusal correctly and telling the WARM, so it stops pushing into a closed
  quota (LBF: `_spotifyBackingOff`, `SPOTIFY_BACKOFF_WINDOW`).
- **Tag the refusal on the answer itself** — LBF answers `$collect->(undef, 'refused')`; PFR
  passes a 6th `$refused` argument to `_svcCantAnswer`, which answers `$collect->(undef, $standing, 1)`
  — rather than leaving callers to infer it from a global flag. The free pass below and the pacing both
  need to know that THIS search was refused, not merely that a refusal happened recently.
- **Every loop that searches must check the back-off itself; nothing inherits it.** LBF has
  THREE consumers: `_resolveTracks`'s `paced` option, the prewarm queue's pause
  (`_detailPriorityBusy`), and the trending-albums gate in `_buildAlbumsData`. That gate calls
  the album search directly rather than through `_resolveTracks`, and for two review rounds it
  went unpaced while the ledger said "the album side is `_detailPriorityBusy`". When you add or
  review a pump, list every caller of the search functions — not the callers of the paced helper.
  PFR has ONE consumer, `_resolveSection` in `warm` mode; its home shelves call the same pump in
  `shelf` mode, but only when Material asks for the home page, so like a view they are never paced.
- **A refusal can answer SYNCHRONOUSLY — do not treat "synchronous" as "cached".** Spotty
  refuses in the same call stack (`getToken` does `return $cb->(-429)` and `_call` hands that
  straight on; `API/Pipeline.pm` adds no deferral — read in Spotty's source, 2026-09-16). A pump
  that skips its gap for any in-loop completion, on the grounds that only a cache hit answers
  in-loop, will run a Spotify-only pass straight through the lockout. The resolver must pass the
  refusal up (LBF: a 4th callback arg on the track path, `_refused` on the album result; PFR 0.9.39:
  `_refused` on the answer, forwarded by every wrapper that makes more than one search — the
  subtitle retry, each side of an "A / B" review — and given to callers that joined the search),
  and the pump must hold on it — with a flag that stops the LAUNCH LOOP, because arming a wakeup
  from inside the loop does not stop the loop. **Keep the gap to ONE wakeup, re-armed:** a timer
  per completion leaves one per search in flight when the back-off starts, and each stray sends a
  search the moment it fires (found in LBF 1.0.1 and in PFR 0.9.37).
- **Back off on your OWN clock.** A flag the service plugin clears on its next SUCCESSFUL
  response reads false while you are still being refused, because at a low priority it may be
  many albums before one is sent.
- **Pace the WARM only.** A view has somebody waiting on it. Always-on pacing was built in PFR
  0.9.36 and rejected as far too slow; do not propose it again.
- **A refusal must not spend a retry budget** where the plugin has one (LBF's
  `MISS_RETRY_SCHEDULE`): the search was never sent, so counting it retires a release the
  service actually carries — and for a user whose ONLY service is the rate-limited one, every
  attempt during a storm is a refusal. Give the attempt back, and **cap** the free passes so
  the miss still converges.
- **The quota may not be the user's alone.** Spotty ships one built-in client id that every
  install shares unless the user sets their own, and Spotify counts per app over a rolling
  30-second window. Assume a narrower budget than a per-user one.

Full working, measurements and the live evidence: `docs/spotify-rate-limits.md` **in the LBF repo**
(`LMS-ListenBrainz-New-Releases`); PFR and LL carry no copy of it.

---

## 7. Summary: what not to do

- Do not add a per-service branch outside the adapter table.
- Do not bump a cache key when registering an adapter.
- Do not modify the shared matcher (`_albumMatches`, `_trackMatches`, `_norm`).
- Do not send normalised text to a service's search.
- Do not report a permanent failure as inconclusive.
- Do not let an empty answer from a rate-limited service stand as a no-match, and do not add a
  backoff the service plugin already performs.
- Do not assume a synchronous answer is a cache hit — a refusal can be synchronous too.
- Do not return an item with a coderef url from a track leg.
- Do not construct playable items by hand.
- Do not probe methods with `->can` that the adapter does not call.
- Do not overwrite `image` or a working `favorites_url`.
- Do not perform synchronous network or parsing work in a leg.

---

## 8. Adapter-table fields still to be added

These sites currently need an edit when a service is added. Sites are named by sub, not line
number: line numbers drift with every release (the ones this table used to carry were already
wrong when checked on 2026-09-16). Each is a one-off improvement to
the registry, not work for an adapter author; close them as they come up.

### LBF

| Site | What it does today | Field that removes it |
|---|---|---|
| `Browse.pm` `_rebuildStreamItems` | Per-service branch chain mapping a service to its rebuild coderef | `rebuild => sub { … }` on the entry, resolved by name |
| `Browse.pm` `_attachFavUrl` | Early return for the one service whose own favourites url is already correct. The early return also drops every handshake field for that service — see "The handshake has ONE carrier" in section 4 | `native_favurl => 1` |
| `Browse.pm` `_candReleaseType` | Reads a fixed list of type and count field names | Generic by field name already; a service using a new field name needs `type_fields` / `count_field` |
| `Browse.pm` `_svcYear` | Reads a fixed list of date field names | `date_fields` |
| `Browse.pm` `_findPlayable` and `_warmReleaseDetails` (the `ne 'Bandcamp'` filters), `_releaseDetail` (`$canBandcamp`), `_bandcampSearchRow` / `_searchBandcampOnly` | One service is excluded from automatic search and offered as a manual action instead | `auto_search => 0` and `manual_action => 1` |
| `Settings.pm` `prefs` and the priority loop in `handler`, the `svc_priority_*` defaults in `Plugin.pm`, `Browse.pm` `serviceStatus` (`@known`) | Four hand-maintained lists of service names | A single services table all four read. The settings template already iterates generically and needs no change |

### Other plugins

| Plugin | Sites | Field that removes it |
|---|---|---|
| PFR | **None — both sites closed with the Spotify adapter.** The rebuild chain is gone (each entry carries `rebuild`), the Spotify favurl exemption is `native_favurl => 1`, and the memo key, settings list and service-status list all read one `@SERVICES` table in `Browse.pm`. The pref default in `Plugin.pm` is the one hand edit left, which is the rule's own "one pref default" | — |
| LL | See section 9 | — |

---

## 9. Per-plugin status

| Plugin | Adapters | Cost of a new service today | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LBF** | Qobuz, Bandcamp, TIDAL, Deezer, Spotify | About 200 lines: two legs, one pref default, one settings entry, one rebuild branch | Ready |
| **PFR** | Qobuz, TIDAL, Deezer, Spotify | About 70 lines: one album leg, one table entry (with `rebuild`), one `@SERVICES` row, one pref default | Ready — no out-of-table edits left |
| **LL** | qobuz, bandcamp, tidal, deezer, spotify, via a url-scheme map (`%SCHEME` in `Sources.pm`) | About 150 lines across ten per-source branches in `Sources.pm` and `Plugin.pm` | Works; refactor still owed |

LL works differently by design: it does not search a service, it **recognises** one from the
url scheme of a row the user acted on, then replays it. Its contract is "recognise and
replay" rather than "search and render".

**Corrected by the Spotify build (LL 0.1.113).** This section previously said full support
required collecting the branches into a sources table of coderefs *first*. That turned out
to be wrong, and the estimate of "roughly fifteen" branches with it: Spotify was added with
full parity — album replay, track saves, playlists, search fallback, release-type
classification and artist backfill — in ten branches and no refactor, because the
branches are each two or three lines selecting a coderef and a passthrough shape, and they
are all named after the same source tag. The refactor is still worth doing and is still not
a prerequisite; do not let it block the next service.

What the branches are, so the next one can be counted rather than guessed at. Six are
unconditional: `_streamingAlbumNode`, `_streamingPlaylistNode`, `_searchService`,
`_serviceCan`, `_serviceCanPlaylist`, and `%SUPPORTED_CMD` in `Plugin.pm`. Four depend on
what the service is like:

- `classifyRelType` — only if the service states a type or count on its album object.
- `_backfillStreamingArtist` — only if its rows can arrive artist-less, or (as Spotify's can) with a sibling's row label as the title.
- `sourceFromSvc` / `%SVC_ALIAS` — only if the service plugin's browse command is not its
  service's name. Spotty registers `tag => 'spotty'` for the source LL calls `spotify`.
- `normaliseFavurl` — only if its favurl is not a `<scheme>://` url. Spotty sends the bare
  URI `spotify:album:<id>`; see §2's note on checking the favurl's shape.

**The last two were MISSED by this list when the Spotify build first wrote it**, which is
exactly the failure the count exists to prevent: both are conditional, like the two above
them, so a service needing neither reads the list as complete and a service needing one
finds nothing telling it to look. The cost is silent — a missed alias drops the native
album id and the row falls back to fuzzy search; a missed normalisation misreads the favurl
in all four of LL's readers at once. **When you add a branch for a new service, add it here
in the same session, and say what makes it conditional.**

## 10. Definition of done

Code:

- [ ] `perl -c` is clean — and note that it does **not** catch calls to subs that don't
      exist, so every new sub must be exercised at least once by a test or a manual run.
- [ ] Tests do not assert with a bare `ok($src =~ /re/, '…')`; in list context that passes
      when the match fails. Bind the match result first.
- [ ] No cache-key bumps, no shared-matcher changes, no new per-service branches.

On a server with the service plugin installed:

- [ ] The settings page lists the service, shows the correct installed state, and a changed
      priority takes effect on the next browse.
- [ ] A known album resolves to the service, and the log names the winning service.
- [ ] **Re-open the same page.** The match must still be present and still play. This is the
      rebuild test and it is the one most likely to be skipped.
- [ ] Setting the service's priority to 0 hides its cached matches immediately, without a
      re-search.
- [ ] With the service made to fail, the chosen TTL matches R5: a transient failure retries
      within the hour, a permanent one does not.
- [ ] An accented artist name returns results, confirming `query_enc`.
- [ ] If the adapter emits a favourites url, save a row in Listen to Later and confirm the
      artist, album, year and type all arrived intact.

State plainly in the commit and the pull request whether the adapter was **verified against
source only** or **run against a live install**. Both are acceptable; leaving it unstated
is not.

---

## 11. What the pull request must contain

1. A verification table: each claim about the service plugin's API, with the `file:line` in
   that plugin's source where it was verified.
2. Any deviation from the pattern in this document, with the reason.
3. A coverage statement: grep an existing service's name across the repo and confirm every
   site found is either updated or generic.
4. No changelog entry. The changelog is written when the branch is merged.

## Appendix — worked example: YouTube Music

Assessment of [`schmij97/lms-ytmusic`](https://github.com/schmij97/lms-ytmusic)
(`Plugins::YouTubeMusic`) against section 2, read from published source on 2026-09-02 and
not yet run.

| Req | Finding | Met |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | `Plugins::YouTubeMusic::API->search($query, 'albums'\|'songs', $cb)` | Yes |
| R2 | `Plugin::_items_to_menu` renders albums with `url => \&_playlist_menu`, `passthrough => [{ browseId }]`, `play => ytmplaylist://<id>` | Yes |
| R3 | `\&Plugins::YouTubeMusic::Plugin::_playlist_menu`, with `browseId` in the passthrough | Yes |
| R4 | Songs render `url => "ytm://<videoId>"`, a plain string | Yes |
| R5 | The API layer calls back `undef` on transport or JSON failure and an arrayref otherwise | Yes |
| R6 | Escapes with `uri_escape_utf8` → `query_enc => 'chars'` | Yes |
| R7 | `<icon>` present in `install.xml` | Yes |
| R8 | Probe `API->can('search')`, `Plugin->can('_items_to_menu')`, `Plugin->can('_playlist_menu')` | Yes |

Two items to settle before or during implementation:

- **Type and year.** No release-type field is exposed, so candidates classify as unknown.
  The `year` field is read from a column that the service often fills with the release type
  instead, so confirm it against live results before stamping `_year`.
- **Availability signal.** Search is served by a local helper process rather than by the Perl
  plugin itself. `->can` confirms the plugin loaded, not that the helper is running, so an
  unreachable helper reports inconclusive. If that state can persist, detect it and report a
  real miss instead, per R5.

Catalogue precision is lower than the subscription services, since the search index includes
re-uploads and alternate versions. A low default priority is appropriate.
